        move = random.choice(["twirl", "shake", "spin", "moonwalk", "robot"])
        print(f"Robot: *{move} move*")
        time.sleep(1)  # Pause for 1 second between moves
    print("Robot: *stops dancing*")

def main():
    while True:
        enable_dance = input("Do you want the robot to dance? (Y/n): ").strip().lower()
        if enable_dance == 'y':
            dance()
        elif enable_dance == 'n':
            print("Robot: Okay, no dancing today.")
            break

This version of the script adds a `dance()` function that randomly selects dance moves from a list and performs them for a set number of times. Each move is printed to the console, and there's a 1-second pause between moves.
